# SortVisualizerC
A sort visualizer in C  
"Work in progress"  

command to compile: gcc -o test main.c sort.c visuals.c -lSDL2  

  
Still need to implement other sorts. Visuals could use some fine tuning too, kind of "ugly",  
but a good starting point. Text needs to be added, so values of each bar can be shown.

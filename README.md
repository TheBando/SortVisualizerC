# SortVisualizerC
A sort visualizer in C  
"Work in progress"  

command to compile: gcc -o test main.c sort.c visuals.c -lSDL2  

  
Still need to implement other sorts. Visuals could use some fine tuning too, kind of "ugly",  
but a good starting point. Text needs to be added, so values of each bar can be shown.  

  updated to add radix sort, and tested up to 50 elements in the array, and the bars scale accordingly. Still have not tested on windows. Need to get on top of that
